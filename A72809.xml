            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the moſt Honorable Aſſemblie the Commons Houſe of Parliament,</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the Engliſh Brokers lawfully admitted to deale betweene Marchants in London.</head>
            <opener>Most humbly Shewenig,</opener>
            <p>THat for many ages paſt, it was the vſe and cuſtome of the Cittie of London, that none but freemen of that Cittie being Engliſh men borne, and houſeſholders, ſhould be admitted to excerſiſe the trade of a Broker betweene Marchant and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, whereby great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity did ariſe to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Wealth for many yeers together.</p>
            <p>That in theſe dayes many ſtrangers borne, and the ſonnes of Aliens, and others not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully admitted, doe vſe and exerciſe Brocage betweene Marchants, by which meanes many intolerable and inſupportable miſcheifes do daylie happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this Kingdome and State.</p>
            <p>The Petitioners further ſhewes that thoſe commodities which in times paſt did ariſe to the Common Wealth, by the admiſſion onely of Engliſh Brokers, cannot conueniently be reeſtabliſhed, nor the miſchiefes now daylie happening to this State, by the permiſſion of Strangers Brokers, be preuented or reformed but onely by authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Petitioners therefore moſt humbly pray, that for the reaſons hereunto annexed it may be ordeyned, that from henceforth no ſtranger: nor the ſonnes of any Alien ſhall exerciſe Brocage in any wiſe, in any place of his Highnes Dominions.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reaſons.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commodities arriſing to the Common wealth by the admiſſion onely of Engliſh Brokers:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt they ſhalbe witneſſes of all ſales made by ſtrangers of Marchandizes imported, and ſhall keepe a perticuler remembrance of what Marchandize, by whom, vnto whom, and for how much the ſame ſhalbe ſould, by which meanes the ſtate vpon all occaſions may be truely enformed, of the nature of their trading, and the difference betweene their importation, and tranſportation.</p>
               <p>Secondly the debts eſtate and ſubſtance of the ſtraingers may be hereby vpon all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions diſcouered, as alſo how much monyes they put ouer by Exchange: and what ſomes they haue at Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the trade of Engliſh ſubiects wilbe hereby greatly aduanced, becauſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Aliens ought not to trade, or deale one with another in this Kingdome, but are to ſell their commodities imported onely to his Maieſties Engliſh ſubiects.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The inconueniences happening to this State by the permiſſion of Strangers and the ſonnes of Aliens to be Brokers.</head>
               <p>Firſt thereby the Strangers is made acquainted with the ſecrets of our trade and dealings in this Land, for they haue Brokers and Factors of their owne nations, not onely in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but in Exceter, Norwich, Colcheſter, Canterbury, Sandwich, and many other places, who bye and ſell for them in this Kingdome, both ingroſſe and by retaile, all manner of Clothes and Stuffes, made and wrought aſwell by ſtrangers as Engliſh, thereby driuing a wounderfull home trade in this realme, to their priuate inriching, and impoueriſhment of the Engliſh borne ſubiects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by permiſſion of Strangers Brokers the eſtate of the Marchant Stranger is kept ſecret, and by reaſon that no accompt is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their trading, it is to be ſuſpected that their moneyes are made ouer by Exchange, or molton into Bullion, and tranſported in reſpect, that ſiluer carrieth a hither price in forraigne parts then in this Kingdome, and that there is ſuch ſcarſity therof in this Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the ſtrangers Brokers, ſeekeing the profit of the Marchant ſtrangers and onely how to ſell his commodities at the vttermoſt price, and the Marchant ſtrangers likewiſe, wiſhing the profit onely of the ſtrangers Brokers: the prices of forraigne Marchandize are theerby inhaunced the value of the commodities of this Land: much debaſed, and the ſaile of forraigne commodities imported into this Land, by Engliſh Marchants greately neglected and hindered.</p>
               <p>By which reaſon it playnely appeareth that by the ſuppreſſion of ſtrangers Brokers and admiſſion onely of the Engliſh, the trade of ſtrangers wil be diſcouered, the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Engliſh kept ſecret, the natiues of this realme releiued, and the conueying ouer of monyes by exchange and tranſportacon of Bullion the better preuented.</p>
